## README for Glioma Biomarkers Analysis

### Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of **prognostic models for glioblastoma** by integrating **machine learning-based feature selection methods** with **regularised Cox regression**. The study leverages **mRNA expression and survival data** from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, following the **WHO-2021 glioma classification guidelines**.

The analysis involves:\
- **Feature selection methods**, including **Boruta and Random Survival Forests (RSF)**, to enhance model interpretability.\
- **Regularised Cox regression models**, such as **LASSO, Elastic Net, and Ridge**, for survival prediction.\
- **Network-based regularisation techniques (HubCox and OrphanCox)** to incorporate biological network information into prognostic modelling.

By systematically evaluating these methodologies, this project aims to improve the identification of **reliable glioblastoma biomarkers** and contribute to precision oncology.

### **Additional Notes**

-   The workflow allows flexible **disease selection** (e.g., glioblastoma vs astrocytoma).
-   **Gene expression data can be filtered to include only protein-coding genes, lncRNA, or miRNA.**
-   Outputs (plots, tables, models) are stored in the **Results/** directory.
-   Our pipeline is fully compatible with datasets beyond TCGA. Some basic preprocessing may be required to match the expected input format, such as aligning variable names and data types.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Note:* These results may not exactly match those reported in the paper. This is due to variability in the Random Survival Forest (RSF) model's variable importance (VIMP) scores, which are inherently influenced by Monte Carlo effects. As stated in the [`randomForestSRC` package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForestSRC/randomForestSRC.pdf):   
*" (...) VIMP and many other statistics are dependent on additional randomization, which we do not consider part of the model. These statistics are susceptible to Monte Carlo effects."*
