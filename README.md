## README for Glioma Biomarkers Analysis

### Project Overview

This project aims to identify and validate glioma biomarkers that can
distinguish high-risk from low-risk patients. The analysis is based on
gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and involves
using multiple machine learning models, including Regularized Cox
Regression, SIS, ISIS, Random Forest, Causal Forest, and Boruta.

### Repository Structure

-   **R Scripts**:

    -   `Glioma_Biomarkers_Analysis.Rmd`: The main R Markdown file
        containing the entire analysis workflow.

    -   `SIMPLIFIED_CLASSIFICATION_TCGA_2016_2021.csv`: A CSV file with
        simplified classification data used for analysis.

-   **Data**:

    -   `GDCdata/`: Directory where TCGA data is downloaded and stored.

-   **Output**:

    -   `Results/`: Directory where results such as tables, plots, and
        models are stored.

### Dependencies

This project uses the `renv` package to manage dependencies. To ensure
reproducibility, the exact package versions used in this analysis are
recorded in the `renv.lock` file.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ``` r
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Restore the R Environment**:

    -   Make sure R is installed on your system.

    -   Open R or RStudio in the project directory.

    -   Run the following command to restore the environment:

        ``` r
        renv::restore()
        ```

3.  **Run the Analysis**:

    -   Open the `Glioma_Biomarkers_Analysis.Rmd` file in RStudio.

    -   Knit the file to generate the HTML report:

        ``` r
        rmarkdown::render("Glioma_Biomarkers_Analysis.Rmd")
        ```

### Project Workflow

1.  **Data Download and Preparation**:

    -   TCGA data is downloaded using the `TCGAbiolinks` package.

    -   Survival and gene expression data are extracted and cleaned.

2.  **Normalization**:

    -   Gene expression data is normalized using the EdgeR package.

3.  **Model Fitting**:

    -   Multiple machine learning models are trained to identify
        biomarkers.

    -   The performance of each model is evaluated using the C-index.

4.  **Outlier Detection**:

    -   Outliers are identified using the rank product test, and models
        are re-evaluated after their removal.

5.  **Analysis of the Best Model**:

    -   The best model is selected based on the highest average C-index,
        and further analysis is performed to evaluate its performance.

### Key Functions

-   `createSurvivalDataFrame()`: Extracts survival data.

-   `cleanSurvivalData()`: Cleans the survival data.

-   `createGeneExpressionDataframe()`: Extracts gene expression data.

-   `fit_models()`: Fits various machine learning models.

-   `calculate_c_index()`: Calculates the C-index for model evaluation.

-   `calculate_martingale_residuals()`: Computes martingale residuals
    for outlier detection.

-   `calculate_rank_product()`: Calculates the rank product for outlier
    detection.

### Results

-   **Model Performance**:

    -   The summary tables provide the average C-index, standard
        deviation, average number of coefficients, and the percentage of
        non-convergence across different models.

-   **Outliers**:

    -   Outliers are identified based on the rank product test and
        removed to improve model performance.
